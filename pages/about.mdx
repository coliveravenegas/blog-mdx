# Hi, there

## My name is Carlos Olivera and this is my first mdx page

There was no good info at the NextJS docs about how to configure NextJS with MDX I guess, but finally I found some info about how to configure it.

This we're some problems I encountered

- Bad knowledge about how the `next.config.js` works (more on this later)
- Bad knowledge and how to import modules in an old fashion way (forget ECMAScript modules xD)
